Note Terra has been manually installed from Modrinth, since the CurseForge version is outdated.
For Terra worldgen to work, you'll need to drop it in your mods folder. (https://modrinth.com/plugin/terra/version/6.2.1-BETA-forge)
This isn't required for now, since worldgen is still incredibly unfinished. Feel free to ignore this (or don't lol).
