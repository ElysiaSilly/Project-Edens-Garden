# Project Eden's Garden

The official repo and issue tracker for Project Eden's Garden, a Minecraft 1.19.2 Forge Modpack.

# Note

Terra worldgen is being worked on and is still incredibly unfinished. 
If you for whatever reason want to check it out, you'll have to [manually install the mod from Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/plugin/terra/version/6.2.1-BETA-forge) and set the World Type on the world creation screen to "edens-garden".

# Setup

Run the "setup.bat" file in the root directy, it'll handle setting up the instance. Feel free to move the instance to your launcher of choice.
